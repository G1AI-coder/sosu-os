SOSU OS Kernel v3.0

> An operating system and programming language built from scratch by a 11-year-old programmer.

SOSU OS is a fully custom OS kernel written in pure C. It includes:
- A built-in programming language with C#/C++/Rust-inspired syntax
- Virtual machine with typed stack and memory management
- Garbage collector (GC)
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler
- Performance profiler
- System calls (files, network, threads, crypto)
- Modular architecture

This is not an emulator. This is a complete system from the ground up â€” made for learning, experimenting, and pushing limits.
